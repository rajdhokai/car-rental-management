          3.When a customer produces the booking voucher provided to him it earlier, it implies that he have read and
          understood all terms and conditions mentioned herewith and agrees on all of them.<br>
          4.After completion of journey, the customer is expected to fill a Duty slip, stating his/her experience with

          festival bonanza etc.<br>
          5.Unless specified otherwise, all meter readings/distances/timings will be calculated to and fro from our
          vendors’ garage.<br>
          6.Distances between two locations (points) be it an intercity distance or from vendors garage etc mentioned on
          the website are approximate. Actual distance may differ depending on the exact geographical location of the
          points under consideration.<br>
          7.Car air-conditioner will not work on hilly routes & also when the vehicle is not in motion. The customer is
          also not expected to request driver to make the air condition operational in the aforementioned cases.<br>
          8.Any form of discounts are only applicable only on the basic fare and cannot be made available on extra
          charges like toll, taxes, charges on for extra Kms consumed if applicable, charges for extra hours consumed if
          applicable, driver allowance, parking, night charges, unless specified.<br>
          9.The vehicle booked will be subject to availability. In a case where the car booked is not available on the
          day of travel the customer will be provided with an alternative equivalent vehicle in the similar segment as
          applicable.<br>
          10.It may happen that for some travel routes, the cab model which was reserved earlier by a customer online
          will not be able to actually run during travel due to the prevailing road conditions (OR) the probable danger
          of natural disasters. The reasons mentioned are beyond the control of Jiya A Rent car. In such a case Jiya A
          Rent Car will provide an upgraded cab model which is typically used in that region at an additional charge. If
          the customer does not want Jiya A Rent Car to provide an upgraded car model a refund will be made.<br>
          11.Airport Pick/Drop, Railway Pick/Drop and local car rental services are valid only within city limits. For
          the afore mentioned car rental services any request for out station travel beyond city limits will entitle the
          driver to deny services without any liability to refund the booking amount.<br>
          12.Customer is liable to pay waiting charges in the case of delay (be it for any reason) exceeding more than
          30 minutes from the scheduled pick up time.<br>
          13.Customer is liable to pay for any additional distance traveled and also for additional hourly charges if
          applicable. Any unscheduled changes will attract additional charges as applicable.<br>
          14.All bookings under consideration are on a calendar day basis i.e. from midnight 12:00 to midnight 12:00. As
          an example for a cab booked for 1st Jan where the pickup time is 5:00 p.m. the booking will be valid till 1st
          Jan 11:59 p.m. and not 2nd Jan 5:00 p.m.<br>
          15.Cabs that are booked for outstation (any or all of One way, round trip & multicity) cannot be used for
          local travel. As an example if a customer books a cab from Mumbai to Shirdi then to Pune and back to Mumbai
          for a period of 3 days in total & has a predefined Km limit of 750 Kms and he returns back to Mumbai on the
          second day & has a balance Km limit of 50 with one day remaining, in spite of this he is not entitled to
          consume this 50Kms for local travel in Mumbai (Source city), however the customer can travel from Mumbai to
          some other city outside city limits of Mumbai (say Thane) & consume the remaining 50 Kms or more than this by
          paying additional charges.<br>
          16.One way car rental services have all travel charges like toll, taxes etc applicable when the vehicle
          returns back to its original location (garage) after dropping the customer to his destination. As example if a
          customer avails one way car rental service from Pune to Mumbai, he will have to pay all charges applicable
          while the vehicle returns back from Mumbai to Pune. The total charges to be borne by the customer for this
          return trip will be slightly lower than the charges for the first trip i.e. from Pune to Mumbai.<br>
          17.If needed, a customer can amend his booking from one way to round trip or from one way to multi city while
          his travel is in progress. A request for amendment while mentioning the CRN number & reason for amendment has
          to be made to the support team at Jiya A Rent Car by reaching them on 9967999444. Whether or not to make an
          amendment as per the request of the customer solely rests with our support team. If the amendment request by
          the customer is approved our support team they will guide on the difference amount to be paid to the driver as
          to make the amendment a reality. This amount has to be paid immediately to the driver in cash after our team
          makes an amendment, failure to do so will not make the requested amendment a reality.<br>
          18.The driver will wait for the customer on the travel date for not more than 60 minutes from his pick up time
          in a case the customer does not inform the driver on the delay, after 60 minutes the booking will be
          considered as a case of no show and full booking amount will be forfeited.<br>
          19.For all travel types (one way, round trip & local) customer has to bear all extra charges like driver
          allowance, toll, taxes, charges on for extra Kms consumed if applicable, charges for extra hours consumed if
          applicable, parking charges, night charges and any other charges applicable as mentioned on the voucher.<br>
          20.For one way outstation trips the customer will pay for any additional charges in the case where the driver
          needs to cover additional distance (or) needs additional duration to complete his return journey (whichever of
          these two higher).<br>
          21.Transfers with unspecified distance coverage will only include one way transfer either from airport or
          railway station to a single location or vice versa. Pickups or drops from multiple locations are not included
          in such bookings.<br>
          22.Cumulative amount of monetary discount shown on our website is only for indicative purpose. The exact
          discount amount or savings offered depends on the service type.<br>
          23.Jiya A Rent Car cannot be hold accountable for any delay or consequential loss caused to the customer due

          30.In a scenario, where in a customer already has received the driver & cab details and the cab hired does not
          show up on the day of travel, it will be considered as the failure of the fleet partner of Jiya A Rent Car.
          <br> Jiya A Rent Car being an on-line car aggregator will take all necessary efforts to provide the customer an alternative
          mode of transport immediately, in the shortest possible time & if failing to do so will provide the customer a
          full refund, which will be processed in a maximum 7 days from the day the cab travel was scheduled to begin.
